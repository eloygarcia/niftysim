NIFTY SIM

===================================================================================

ABOUT

Nifty Sim is a high-performance nonlinear explicit finite element solver, developed
for use in surgical simulation and medical imaging applications. A key feature is
the option of GPU-based execution, which allows the solver to significantly out
-perform equivalent commercial packages. The package was developed at University
College London, and is based on work presented in Taylor et al.[1-3]. The main
algorithm and its GPU implementation was described in [1,2]. The newer reduced order
modelling components were described in [3]. We would appreciate it if you would cite
the relevant papers if you use Nifty Sim in your work.
